            **Research Questions**
            - What areas of the city (borough, community district, etc.) are seeing the most construction of housing? How many units can be expected?
            - What kinds of housing are being prioritized by the city? New developments? Renovations? Low density? High density? Luxury? Affordable?
            - Do people apply for construction permits in areas with high property prices?

            **Datasets**
            - [Construction Applications](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-NOW-Build-Job-Application-Filings/w9ak-ipjd/about_data)
