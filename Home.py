            - Developed in response to the rising cost of living throughout 
            New York City and, in particular, the rising rents, this project takes maps 
            of construction applications and prices of sold properties in NYC and 
            combines them to understand the relationship between the amount of housing 
            construction and the property prices. 
            - The resulting dashboard helps illustrate how the city is responding to the 
            housing shortage.

            **Research Questions**
            - What areas of the city (borough, community district, etc.) are seeing the most construction of housing? How many units can be expected?
            - What kinds of housing are being prioritized by the city? New developments? Renovations? Low density? High density? Luxury? Affordable?
            - Do people apply for construction permits in areas with high property prices?

            **Data Source**
            - [Construction Applications](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-NOW-Build-Job-Application-Filings/w9ak-ipjd/about_data): Updated daily by the Department of Buildings. The table in Google Cloud is updated daily by the workflow we have set.
