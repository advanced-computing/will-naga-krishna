# Project Title: Mapping Construction in NYC
## Description: This project takes the NYC Department of Construction construction applications and maps them across the city to understand the amount of housing construction the city is undertaking to combat the affordability crisis, where the construction is located and what type of construction there is.

### Use Instruction: We are in the progress of developing the project but we hope that this can provide policymakers and those curious about the city a constant understanding of the current housing construction environment.
